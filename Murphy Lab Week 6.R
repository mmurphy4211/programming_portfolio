#the car with highest result
# add a new column 'efficiency' in the dataframe to store the division result

#standard deviation

#scale mpg first:

# scale 'hp' (scale is subtracting its column mean and then dividing its 
#columnâ€™s standard deviation. But you just use scale function like this:)
scale(myCars$hp)

# Get the index of maximum combination first, and then get its row name. HINT:
#use which.max function AND row.names function
